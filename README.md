## Lighthouse tests

- v0.1.1
  ![lighthouse-0.1.1](./lighthouse-0.1.1.png)
  _a bit better for not that much efforts. Performance score would be far better without using bootstrap (actully fetched from https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com)_

- v0.0.1 (_first version: with no optimizations!_)
  ![lighthouse-test](./lighthouse-test.png)
  _pretty nice for an out of the box starting PWA starter!_

## Detailed Content

**Front:**

- Next js (9.x+ [github :link:](https://github.com/zeit/next.js))
- React JS (16.8.x+ - [github :link:](https://github.com/facebook/react))
- redux (_as your application grows managing state will be a serious concern, save pain with Redux_)
- redux-persist 5.x (_simplifies your NextJS state share between pages_ [github :link:](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist))
- localForage
- react-redux (_Redux is not specific to ReactJS, you could easily use it with Angular2 for instance_)
- redux-thunk (_simple and does the job_)
- next-redux-wrapper
- redux-devtools-extension ([github :link:](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#redux-devtools-extension))
- reactstrap ([github :link:](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap))
- axios ([github :link:](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) _Why: simple, complete, isomorphic ..._)

**Tool chain:**

- Next js (9.x+ [github :link:](https://github.com/zeit/next.js))
- Babel 7+ (*custom babel*)
- Flow JS types

**fav icon:**

- favicons generated by [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)

## Usage

**IMPORTANT: `Next JS` when `redux` connected**

- **you are forced to connect each page** (_even if you don't need redux in that page_) with `withRedux` from `next-redux-wrapper` (_[see page1 as an example](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-redux-nextjs-bootstrap-starter/blob/master/pages/page1.js)_).
- **each sub component you may want to connect** should be connected by usual `connect` from `redux` (_[see Header component as an example](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-redux-nextjs-bootstrap-starter/blob/master/components/header/Header.js)_)

**IMPORTANT: use Layout component on each Page:**

- Layout is the **Layout** (_better to my mind than using `_document`_) of each page
- Layout component will **register the service worker** (_registering an already registered service worker is no effect but ensures it will register at any page user would enter the application_)
