## Detailed Content

**Front:**
- Next js (4.x+ [github :link:](https://github.com/zeit/next.js))
- React JS (16.x+ - [github :link:](https://github.com/facebook/react))
- redux (*as your application grows managing state will be a serious concern, save pain with Redux*)
- redux-persist (*simplifies your NextJS state share between pages* [github :link:](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist))
- localForage
- react-redux (*Redux is not specific to ReactJS, you could easily use it with Angular2 for instance*)
- redux-thunk (*simple and does the job*)
- next-redux-wrapper
- redux-devtools-extension ([github :link:](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#redux-devtools-extension))
- react-bootstrap ([github :link:](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap))
- axios ([github :link:](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) *Why: simple, complete, isomorphic ...*)

**Tool chain:**
- Next js (4.x+ [github :link:](https://github.com/zeit/next.js))
- Flow JS types

## Usage

**IMPORTANT: `Next JS` when `redux` connected**

- **you are forced to connect each page** (*even if you don't need redux in that page*) with `withRedux` from `next-redux-wrapper` (*[see page1 as an example](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-redux-nextjs-bootstrap-starter/blob/master/pages/page1.js)*).
- **each sub component you may want to connect** should be connected by usual `connect` from `redux` (*[see Header component as an example](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-redux-nextjs-bootstrap-starter/blob/master/components/header/Header.js)*)

**IMPORTANT: use Layout component on each Page**
- Layout is the **Layout** (*better to my mind than using `_document`*) of each page
- Layout component will **register the service worker** (*registering an already registered service worker is no effect but ensures it will register at any page user would enter the application*)
